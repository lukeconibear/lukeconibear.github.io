## Overview

Generalist engineer working across software engineering, data engineering, applied ML/data science, and atmospheric science to build production systems.

## Experience

### Senior Software Engineer, Tomorrow.io | 2022--present

- Promoted to Senior Software Engineer after 1 year.
- Primary contributor to a department-wide cloud cost optimization program, delivering a 25% spend reduction in 2025 through information-content compression (`xbitinfo`), spot/reserved capacity strategy, KEDA scale-to-zero, rightsizing, lower cross-cloud/cross-region transfer, and stricter data-retention policies.
- Designed, deployed, and maintained 100+ production microservices and data pipelines in Python, Rust, and Go for ML and physics-based forecasting workflows ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/eRYOcRVB004?si=4RpDk_J68lM2IjD8)).
- Core contributor in Severity-1 incident response; identified recurring failure modes and led preventive fixes that reduced MTTR by 35% from 2024 to 2025.
- Led design and delivery of multi-cloud MLOps infrastructure across Azure ML, AWS SageMaker, and GCP Vertex AI.
- Led refactoring of legacy applications to improve production reliability, maintainability, and operational simplicity.
- Led department-wide adoption of AI-assisted engineering workflows (e.g., [Cursor](https://www.lukeconibear.com/cursor-slides.html)), integrating code review standards, clear documentation, and CI/CD improvements to increase delivery speed and code quality.

### Research Software Engineer Machine Learning, University of Leeds | 2021--2022

- [Taught](https://youtu.be/zbt7aa2QIAA) AI emulators of numerical atmospheric models.
- Authored and maintained an open-source course for [High-Performance Python](https://www.lukeconibear.com/swd6_hpp/) and [Machine Learning](https://www.lukeconibear.com/intro_ml/).

### Research Fellow, University of Leeds | 2018--2021

- Engineered [AI emulators](https://www.lukeconibear.com/atmospheric_science/emulator/) (`scikit-learn`, `tpot`) to act as fast proxies for complex atmospheric simulations (~20 TB of data), distributing training across high-performance compute clusters (`dask`).
- Maintained and supported [`WRFotron`](https://github.com/wrfchem-leeds/WRFotron), an open-source automation tool for atmospheric modeling, managing GitHub releases, [documentation](https://wrfchem-leeds.github.io/WRFotron/index.html), and a community of users.
