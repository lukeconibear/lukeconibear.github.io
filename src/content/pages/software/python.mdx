# Python

- I mainly use Python with the scientific stack of libraries.

## Projects

- I created an online course on [High Performance Python](https://lukeconibear.com/swd6_hpp/).
  - It includes profiling, vectorisation with NumPy, compiling with Numba, parallelisation with Dask and Ray, and using GPUs with JAX and CUDA/Numba.
