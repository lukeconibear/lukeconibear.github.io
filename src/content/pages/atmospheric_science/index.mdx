## Research

I used complex numerical models to understand how to improve air quality and public health in India, China, Indonesia, and South America.

I quantified how clean household energy can improve air quality and public health in India ([interactive map](/atmospheric_science/plot_india_solid_fuel/)).

I completed a PhD in [Ambient air quality and human health in India](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/22488/) from the University of Leeds.

- I quantified the key sources of air pollution exposure in India, the impact of air pollution exposure on human health, and how might this change in the future.
- Overall, the disease burden associated with air pollution exposure in India is large, increasing, and dominated by solid fuel use (especially in homes).
- I was inspired by [Kirk R. Smith](https://youtu.be/tsQfeVkx6Fw) and [Hans Rosling](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/hans-rosling-and-the-magic-washing-machine/).

## Teaching

I taught and provided support for a complex air quality model, [WRFChem](https://wrfchem-leeds.github.io/WRFotron/) (Bash and Fortran).

I gave lectures on air pollution and human health ([slides](https://www.lukeconibear.com/air_pollution_human_health/#/), [code](https://github.com/lukeconibear/air_pollution_human_health)).

I taught and provided support for [epidemiological models](https://github.com/lukeconibear/health_impact_assessment).
