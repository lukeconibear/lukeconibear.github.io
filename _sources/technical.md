## Python

I mainly use Python with the scientific stack of libraries (e.g., Numpy, xarray, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter, Dask).  

Here is a course I created on [High Performance Python](https://arctraining.github.io/swd6_hpp/). It includes profiling, vectorisation with NumPy, compiling with Numba, parallelisation with Dask and Ray, and using GPUs with JAX and CUDA/Numba.  

## Numerical atmospheric models

I taught and provided support for a complex air quality model, [WRFChem](https://wrfchem-leeds.github.io/WRFotron/) (Bash and Fortran).  

## Machine learning

I used [machine learning models](/emulator) to predict optimum emission reduction strategies to improve air quality and public health in China. These were Gaussian process emulators trained from ~20 TB of simulated data from numerical atmospheric models.  

I provided training for these emulators

Here is a course I created on an [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://arctraining.github.io/swd8_intro_ml/). It covers fundamentals, machine learning with scikit-learn, deep learning with TensorFlow / Keras and PyTorch / PyTorch Lightning, data pipelines, model tuning, transfer learning, and distributed training.  

## Useful learning resources

[Here](/useful_learning_resources) are some great learning resources for topics in data science, software engineering, and machine learning that I've found helpful.
