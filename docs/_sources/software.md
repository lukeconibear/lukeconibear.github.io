## Python

I use Python (primary libraries: Numpy, xarray, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter, Dask) to analyse the large amounts of data produced by complex air quality models.  

I taught an [Introdution to Scientific Computing](https://www.lukeconibear.com/introduction_to_scientific_computing/index.html) covering Python, Linux, and GitHub.  

I taught and provided support for [epidemiological models](https://github.com/lukeconibear/health_impact_assessment).  

I used machine learning models to predict optimum emission reduction strategies to improve air quality and public health in China ([code](https://github.com/lukeconibear/emulator) using scitkit-learn and TPOT, [academic paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021GH000391)).  

I quantified how clean household energy can improve air quality and public health in India ([interactive map](https://bag.leeds.ac.uk/projects/air-quality-in-asia/household-energy-and-air-quality-in-india/), [code](https://github.com/lukeconibear/Conibear_et-al_2020_ERL_dash-app) using Plot.ly Dash).  

([interactive map](/plot_india_solid_fuel)).  

## WRFChem

I taught and provided support for a [complex air quality model](https://wrfchem-leeds.github.io/WRFotron/) (Bash and Fortran).
