## Python

I mainly use Python (primary libraries: Numpy, xarray, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter, Dask) to analyse the large amounts of data produced by complex air quality models.  

I provided training for scientific computing (Python, Linux, and GitHub). For example, [explaining](https://www.lukeconibear.com/introduction_to_scientific_computing/tips_to_speed_up_python.html) how to speed up Python code.  

## Complex air quality model

I taught and provided support for a complex air quality model, [WRFChem](https://wrfchem-leeds.github.io/WRFotron/) (Bash and Fortran).  

## Emulation of complex air quality model
[Here](/emulator) I used machine learning models (Gaussian process emulation trained from ~20 TB of simulated data) to predict optimum emission reduction strategies to improve air quality and public health in China.  

## Useful learning resources
[Here](/useful_learning_resources) are some great learning resources for topics in data science, software engineering, and machine learning that I've found helpful.
