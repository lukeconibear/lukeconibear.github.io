## Research

I'm a research fellow in air quality at the University of Leeds, UK.  

I use complex air quality models to understand how policies can improve air quality and reduce the impact on human health in India, China, Indonesia, and South America.  

I completed a PhD in [Ambient air quality and human health in India](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/22488/) from the University of Leeds.
- I quantified the key sources of air pollution exposure in India, the impact of air pollution exposure on human health, and how might this change in the future.  
- Overall, the disease burden associated with air pollution exposure in India is large, increasing, and dominated by solid fuel use (especially in homes).  
- I was inspired by [Kirk R. Smith](https://www.kirkrsmith.org/) and [Hans Rosling](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/hans-rosling-and-the-magic-washing-machine/).  

## Teaching

I gave lectures on air pollution and human health ([slides](https://www.lukeconibear.com/air_pollution_human_health/#/), [code](https://github.com/lukeconibear/air_pollution_human_health)).
