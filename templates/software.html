    <h3>WRF-Chem</h3>

    <div style="clear:left;">
        <ul>
            <li>In my PhD and work as an air pollution researcher, I've simulated air quality using a numerical weather prediction model (<a href="https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/wrf-chem" target="_blank">WRF-Chem</a>) on a high-performance computer.</li>
            <li>As there is little training online for this model, I've taught it to research staff and PhD students, and I've created and maintained an exhaustive user guide (<a href="https://github.com/wrfchem-leeds/WRFotron/blob/master/WRFotron_user_guide.md" target="_blank">here</a>), which continues to be used for training.</li>
            <li>More details can be found on the WRF-Chem at the University of Leeds <a href="https://github.com/wrfchem-leeds" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</li>
